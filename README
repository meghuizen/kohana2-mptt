Based on the Kohana 2 original ORM_MPTT in combination with the Kohana 3 ORM_MPTT. I've merged those 2 and worked on it so it would work on Kohana 2. And changed the API a bit so it would work as I liked it. And I fixed a lot of bugs and added some usefull functions.

Works a lot better then the current version for Kohana 2, because that one has functions with a lot of bugs. I also want to make an API compatible version for Kohana 3 of this.


It's not fully API compatible with the Kohana 3 version, because of some API things I didn't agree on with Kohana 3 ORM_MPTT. But most of the part is.

This is working and tested code. And if by any means, your tree fails, you can use rebuild_tree() to rebuild the whole tree.


You can, with this library use:

    $group = ORM::factory('group');
    $group->parent_id = 3;
    $group->save();

also this works:

    $group = ORM::factory('group', 3);
    $group->parent_id = 5;
    $group->save();

So both insert and move works via the save() function.
